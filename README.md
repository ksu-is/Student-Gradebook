# Student-Gradebook
This software idea is made for students to keep track of grades, view past grades, and add grades to see what you need to get the grade you desire. The students would be able to see their grades averaged out in a easy way to ensure they know where they stand in a particular class. The student could add all of their classes to a journal were it displayed the grades at one time to compare each class with one another
